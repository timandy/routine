# v1.0.4 Release notes

### Features

- Add zero-copy conversion method between `bytes` and `string`, see `bytesconv.Bytes()` and `bytesconv.String()` methods.

### Changes

- Modify the garbage collection mechanism, remove `gcTimer`, no longer perform garbage collection through timers.
- Store the context in the `g.labels` field of the coroutine structure which will be set to `nil` after coroutine ends. The context data will be collected at the next `GC`.
- Use `go:linkname` to invoke assembly code `getg()` directly to improve performance.
- Implement the `getGoidByStack()` method by invoke `http.http2curGoroutineID()`.
- Remove api `AllGoids()` and `ForeachGoid()`.

# v1.0.3 Release notes

### Features

- Support copy `Cloneable` objects to sub goroutine when create sub goroutines by `Go()`, `GoWait()` and `GoWaitResult()` methods.
- Add api `ForeachGoid(func(goid int64))` to run a func for each goid.

### Changes

- Support go version range `go1.13` ~ `go1.17`(Not support `go1.12` anymore).
- Use segment locks to reduce competition and improve `ThreadLocal`'s `read`, `write` and `gc` performance.
- Get all goids through `runtime.allgs` instead of `runtime.atomicAllG`, so `go1.13` ~ `go1.15` can also get all goids natively.

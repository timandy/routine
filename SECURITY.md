## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

If you found a security vulnerability in the current repository, please send a mail to [Tim Andy](mailto:xuchonglei@126.com).
You should get a reply within *72 hours* that we have received your report and a tentative [CVSS](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator) score.
We will do a preliminary analysis to confirm that the vulnerability is a plausible claim and decline the report otherwise.

If possible, please include:

1. reproducible steps on how to trigger the vulnerability.
2. a description on why you are convinced that it exists.
3. any information you may have on active exploitation of the vulnerability.

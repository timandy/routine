`routine` encapsulates and provides some easy-to-use, non-competitive, high-performance `goroutine` context access interfaces, which can help you access coroutine context information more gracefully.

# Introduce

From the very beginning of its design, the `Golang` language has spared no effort to shield the concept of coroutine context from developers, including the acquisition of coroutine `goid`, the state of coroutine within the process, and the storage of coroutine context.

If you have used other languages such as `C++`, `Java` and so on, then you must be familiar with `ThreadLocal`, but after starting to use `Golang`, you will be deeply confused and distressed by the lack of convenient functions like `ThreadLocal`.

Of course, you can choose to use `Context`, which carries all the context information, appears in the first input parameter of all functions, and then shuttles around your system.

And the core goal of `routine` is to open up another way: Introduce `goroutine local storage` to the `Golang` world.

# Usage & Demo

This chapter briefly introduces how to install and use the `routine` library.

## Install

```bash
go get github.com/timandy/routine
```

## Use `goid`

The following code simply demonstrates the use of `routine.Goid()`:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"

	"github.com/timandy/routine"
)

func main() {
	goid := routine.Goid()
	fmt.Printf("cur goid: %v\n", goid)
	go func() {
		goid := routine.Goid()
		fmt.Printf("sub goid: %v\n", goid)
	}()

	// Wait for the sub-coroutine to finish executing.
	time.Sleep(time.Second)
}
```

In this example, the `main` function starts a new coroutine, so `Goid()` returns the main coroutine `1` and the child coroutine `6`:

```text
cur goid: 1
sub goid: 6
```

## Use `ThreadLocal`

The following code briefly demonstrates `ThreadLocal`'s creation, setting, getting, spreading across coroutines, etc.:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"

	"github.com/timandy/routine"
)

var threadLocal = routine.NewThreadLocal()
var inheritableThreadLocal = routine.NewInheritableThreadLocal()

func main() {
	threadLocal.Set("hello world")
	inheritableThreadLocal.Set("Hello world2")
	fmt.Println("threadLocal:", threadLocal.Get())
	fmt.Println("inheritableThreadLocal:", inheritableThreadLocal.Get())

	// The child coroutine cannot read the previously assigned "hello world".
	go func() {
		fmt.Println("threadLocal in goroutine:", threadLocal.Get())
		fmt.Println("inheritableThreadLocal in goroutine:", inheritableThreadLocal.Get())
	}()

	// However, a new sub-coroutine can be started via the Go/GoWait/GoWaitResul function, and all inheritable variables of the current coroutine can be passed automatically.
	routine.Go(func() {
		fmt.Println("threadLocal in goroutine by Go:", threadLocal.Get())
		fmt.Println("inheritableThreadLocal in goroutine by Go:", inheritableThreadLocal.Get())
	})

	// Wait for the sub-coroutine to finish executing.
	time.Sleep(time.Second)
}
```

The execution result is:

```text
threadLocal: hello world
inheritableThreadLocal: Hello world2
threadLocal in goroutine: <nil>
inheritableThreadLocal in goroutine: <nil>
threadLocal in goroutine by Go: <nil>
inheritableThreadLocal in goroutine by Go: Hello world2
```

# API

This chapter introduces in detail all the interfaces encapsulated by the `routine` library, as well as their core functions and implementation methods.

## `Goid() int64`

Get the `goid` of the current `goroutine`.

It can be obtained directly through assembly code under `386`, `amd64`, `armv6`, `armv7`, `arm64`, `ppc64`, `s390x` architectures. This operation has extremely high performance and the time-consuming is usually only one-fifth of `rand.Int()`.

## `NewThreadLocal() ThreadLocal`

Creates a new `ThreadLocal` instance with a stored default value of `nil`.

## `NewThreadLocalWithInitial(supplier Supplier) ThreadLocal`

Creates a new `ThreadLocal` instance with default values stored by calling `supplier()`.

## `NewInheritableThreadLocal() ThreadLocal`

Creates a new `ThreadLocal` instance with a stored default value of `nil`. When a new coroutine is started via `Go()`, `GoWait()` or `GoWaitResult()`, the value of the current coroutine is copied to the new coroutine.

## `NewInheritableThreadLocalWithInitial(supplier Supplier) ThreadLocal`

Creates a new `ThreadLocal` instance with stored default values generated by calling `supplier()`. When a new coroutine is started via `Go()`, `GoWait()` or `GoWaitResult()`, the value of the current coroutine is copied to the new coroutine.

## `Go(fun func())`

Start a new coroutine and automatically copy all contextual `inheritableThreadLocals` data of the current coroutine to the new coroutine. Any `panic` while the child coroutine is executing will be caught and the stack automatically printed.

## `GoWait(fun func()) Future`

Start a new coroutine and automatically copy all contextual `inheritableThreadLocals` data of the current coroutine to the new coroutine. You can wait for the sub-coroutine to finish executing through the `Future.Get()` method that returns a value. Any `panic` while the child coroutine is executing will be caught and thrown again when `Future.Get()` is called.

## `GoWaitResult(fun func() Any) Future`

Start a new coroutine and automatically copy all contextual `inheritableThreadLocals` data of the current coroutine to the new coroutine. You can wait for the sub-coroutine to finish executing and get the return value through the `Future.Get()` method of the return value. Any `panic` while the child coroutine is executing will be caught and thrown again when `Future.Get()` is called.

# Garbage Collection

`routine` allocates a `thread` structure for each coroutine, which stores context variable information related to the coroutine.

A pointer to this structure is stored on the `g.labels` field of the coroutine structure.

When the coroutine finishes executing and exits, `g.labels` will be set to `nil`, no longer referencing the `thread` structure.

The `thread` structure will be collected at the next `GC`.

If the data stored in `thread` is not additionally referenced, these data will be collected together.
